# Docker Backups

## ./Jenkins
This repo contains the Dockerfile and docker-compose of my Jenkins lab.  

### jenkins.Dockerfile
The Dockerfile contains the docker configurations, apps installations and plugins that I am using in my lab.  
With that, I am able to store it all in an image and make my lab portable and dynamic.
